/**
 * `GFile` is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a
 * virtual file system. `GFile`s are lightweight, immutable objects
 * that do no I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that
 * `GFile` objects do not represent files, merely an identifier for a
 * file. All file content I/O is implemented as streaming operations
 * $(LPAREN)see [Gio.InputStream] and [Gio.OutputStream]$(RPAREN).
 * To construct a `GFile`, you can use:
 * - [Gio.File.newForPath] if you have a path.
 * - [Gio.File.newForUri] if you have a URI.
 * - [Gio.File.newForCommandlineArg] or
 * [Gio.File.newForCommandlineArgAndCwd] for a command line
 * argument.
 * - [Gio.File.newTmp] to create a temporary file from a template.
 * - [Gio.File.newTmpAsync] to asynchronously create a temporary file.
 * - [Gio.File.newTmpDirAsync] to asynchronously create a temporary
 * directory.
 * - [Gio.File.parseName] from a UTF-8 string gotten from
 * [Gio.File.getParseName].
 * - [Gio.File.newBuildFilename] or [Gio.File.newBuildFilenamev]
 * to create a file from path elements.
 * One way to think of a `GFile` is as an abstraction of a pathname. For
 * normal files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as
 * `GFile`s are extensible it could also be something else that corresponds
 * to a pathname in a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
 * `GFile`s make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to
 * the files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with
 * `GFile` using [Gio.File.getParent] to get an identifier for the
 * parent directory, [Gio.File.getChild] to get a child within a
 * directory, and [Gio.File.resolveRelativePath] to resolve a relative
 * path between two `GFile`s. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not
 * end up at the same root if you repeatedly call [Gio.File.getParent]
 * on two different files.
 * All `GFile`s have a basename $(LPAREN)get with [Gio.File.getBasename]$(RPAREN). These
 * names are byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem
 * $(LPAREN)relative to its parent directory$(RPAREN) and there is no guarantees that they
 * have any particular charset encoding or even make any sense at all. If
 * you want to use filenames in a user interface you should use the display
 * name that you can get by requesting the
 * `G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME` attribute with
 * [Gio.File.queryInfo]. This is guaranteed to be in UTF-8 and can be
 * used in a user interface. But always store the real basename or the `GFile`
 * to use to actually access the file, because there is no way to go from a
 * display name to the actual name.
 * Using `GFile` as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path
 * in that there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance,
 * hard or soft links may cause two different `GFile`s to refer to the same
 * file. Other possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems,
 * short and long names on FAT/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to
 * check if two `GFile`s point to the same file you can query for the
 * `G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE` attribute. Note that `GFile` does some trivial
 * canonicalization of pathnames passed in, so that trivial differences in
 * the path string used at creation $(LPAREN)duplicated slashes, slash at end of
 * path, `.` or `..` path segments, etc$(RPAREN) does not create different `GFile`s.
 * Many `GFile` operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions
 * to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions
 * simply have `_async$(LPAREN)$(RPAREN)` appended to their function names. The asynchronous
 * I/O functions call a [Gio.AsyncReadyCallback] which is then used to
 * finalize the operation, producing a [Gio.AsyncResult] which is then
 * passed to the function’s matching `_finish$(LPAREN)$(RPAREN)` operation.
 * It is highly recommended to use asynchronous calls when running within a
 * shared main loop, such as in the main thread of an application. This avoids
 * I/O operations blocking other sources on the main loop from being dispatched.
 * Synchronous I/O operations should be performed from worker threads. See the
 * [introduction to asynchronous programming section](overview.html#asynchronous-programming)
 * for more.
 * Some `GFile` operations almost always take a noticeable amount of time, and
 * so do not have synchronous analogs. Notable cases include:
 * - [Gio.File.mountMountable] to mount a mountable file.
 * - [Gio.File.unmountMountableWithOperation] to unmount a mountable
 * file.
 * - [Gio.File.ejectMountableWithOperation] to eject a mountable file.
 * ## Entity Tags
 * One notable feature of `GFile`s are entity tags, or ‘etags’ for
 * short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
 * traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file
 * has been modified from the version on the file system. See the
 * HTTP 1.1
 * [specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)
 * for HTTP `ETag` headers, which are a very similar concept.
