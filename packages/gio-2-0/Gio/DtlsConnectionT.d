/**
 * `GDtlsConnection` is the base DTLS connection class type, which wraps
 * a [Gio.DatagramBased] and provides DTLS encryption on top of it. Its
 * subclasses, [Gio.DtlsClientConnection] and
 * [Gio.DtlsServerConnection], implement client-side and server-side DTLS,
 * respectively.
 * For TLS support, see [Gio.TlsConnection].
 * As DTLS is datagram based, `GDtlsConnection` implements
 * [Gio.DatagramBased], presenting a datagram-socket-like API for the
 * encrypted connection. This operates over a base datagram connection, which is
 * also a `GDatagramBased` $(LPAREN)property@Gio.DtlsConnection:base-socket$(RPAREN).
 * To close a DTLS connection, use [Gio.DtlsConnection.close].
 * Neither [Gio.DtlsServerConnection] or [Gio.DtlsClientConnection]
 * set the peer address on their base [Gio.DatagramBased] if it is a
 * [Gio.Socket] â€” it is up to the caller to do that if they wish. If they
 * do not, and [Gio.Socket.close] is called on the base socket, the
 * `GDtlsConnection` will not raise a `G_IO_ERROR_NOT_CONNECTED` error on
 * further I/O.
