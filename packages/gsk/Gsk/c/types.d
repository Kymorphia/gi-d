/**
 * A `GskGLShader` is a snippet of GLSL that is meant to run in the
 * fragment shader of the rendering pipeline.
 * A fragment shader gets the coordinates being rendered as input and
 * produces the pixel values for that particular pixel. Additionally,
 * the shader can declare a set of other input arguments, called
 * uniforms $(LPAREN)as they are uniform over all the calls to your shader in
 * each instance of use$(RPAREN). A shader can also receive up to 4
 * textures that it can use as input when producing the pixel data.
 * `GskGLShader` is usually used with [Gtk.Snapshot.pushGlShader]
 * to produce a [Gsk.GLShaderNode] in the rendering hierarchy,
 * and then its input textures are constructed by rendering the child
 * nodes to textures before rendering the shader node itself. $(LPAREN)You can
 * pass texture nodes as children if you want to directly use a texture
 * as input$(RPAREN).
 * The actual shader code is GLSL code that gets combined with
 * some other code into the fragment shader. Since the exact
 * capabilities of the GPU driver differs between different OpenGL
 * drivers and hardware, GTK adds some defines that you can use
 * to ensure your GLSL code runs on as many drivers as it can.
 * If the OpenGL driver is GLES, then the shader language version
 * is set to 100, and GSK_GLES will be defined in the shader.
 * Otherwise, if the OpenGL driver does not support the 3.2 core profile,
 * then the shader will run with language version 110 for GL2 and 130 for GL3,
 * and GSK_LEGACY will be defined in the shader.
 * If the OpenGL driver supports the 3.2 code profile, it will be used,
 * the shader language version is set to 150, and GSK_GL3 will be defined
 * in the shader.
 * The main function the shader must implement is:
 * ```glsl
 * void mainImage$(LPAREN)out vec4 fragColor,
 * in vec2 fragCoord,
 * in vec2 resolution,
 * in vec2 uv$(RPAREN)
 * ```
 * Where the input @fragCoord is the coordinate of the pixel we're
 * currently rendering, relative to the boundary rectangle that was
 * specified in the `GskGLShaderNode`, and @resolution is the width and
 * height of that rectangle. This is in the typical GTK coordinate
 * system with the origin in the top left. @uv contains the u and v
 * coordinates that can be used to index a texture at the
 * corresponding point. These coordinates are in the [0..1]x[0..1]
 * region, with 0, 0 being in the lower left corder $(LPAREN)which is typical
 * for OpenGL$(RPAREN).
 * The output @fragColor should be a RGBA color $(LPAREN)with
 * premultiplied alpha$(RPAREN) that will be used as the output for the
 * specified pixel location. Note that this output will be
 * automatically clipped to the clip region of the glshader node.
 * In addition to the function arguments the shader can define
 * up to 4 uniforms for textures which must be called u_textureN
 * $(LPAREN)i.e. u_texture1 to u_texture4$(RPAREN) as well as any custom uniforms
 * you want of types int, uint, bool, float, vec2, vec3 or vec4.
 * All textures sources contain premultiplied alpha colors, but if some
 * there are outer sources of colors there is a gsk_premultiply$(LPAREN)$(RPAREN) helper
 * to compute premultiplication when needed.
 * Note that GTK parses the uniform declarations, so each uniform has to
 * be on a line by itself with no other code, like so:
 * ```glsl
 * uniform float u_time;
 * uniform vec3 u_color;
 * uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
 * uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
 * ```
 * GTK uses the "gsk" namespace in the symbols it uses in the
 * shader, so your code should not use any symbols with the prefix gsk
 * or GSK. There are some helper functions declared that you can use:
 * ```glsl
 * vec4 GskTexture$(LPAREN)sampler2D sampler, vec2 texCoords$(RPAREN);
 * ```
 * This samples a texture $(LPAREN)e.g. u_texture1$(RPAREN) at the specified
 * coordinates, and contains some helper ifdefs to ensure that
 * it works on all OpenGL versions.
 * You can compile the shader yourself using [Gsk.GLShader.compile],
 * otherwise the GSK renderer will do it when it handling the glshader
 * node. If errors occurs, the returned @error will include the glsl
 * sources, so you can see what GSK was passing to the compiler. You
 * can also set GSK_DEBUG\=shaders in the environment to see the sources
 * and other relevant information about all shaders that GSK is handling.
 * # An example shader
 * ```glsl
 * uniform float position;
 * uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
 * uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
 * void mainImage$(LPAREN)out vec4 fragColor,
 * in vec2 fragCoord,
 * in vec2 resolution,
 * in vec2 uv$(RPAREN) {
 * vec4 source1 \= GskTexture$(LPAREN)u_texture1, uv$(RPAREN);
 * vec4 source2 \= GskTexture$(LPAREN)u_texture2, uv$(RPAREN);
 * fragColor \= position * source1 + $(LPAREN)1.0 - position$(RPAREN) * source2;
