/**
 * The GRWLock struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
 * reader-writer lock. It is similar to a #GMutex in that it allows
 * multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource.
 *
 * The difference to a mutex is that a reader-writer lock discriminates
 * between read-only ('reader') and full ('writer') access. While only
 * one thread at a time is allowed write access (by holding the 'writer'
 * lock via g_rw_lock_writer_lock()), multiple threads can gain
 * simultaneous read-only access (by holding the 'reader' lock via
 * g_rw_lock_reader_lock()).
 *
 * It is unspecified whether readers or writers have priority in acquiring the
 * lock when a reader already holds the lock and a writer is queued to acquire
 * it.
 *
 * Here is an example for an array with access functions:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GRWLock lock;
 * GPtrArray *array;
 *
 * gpointer
 * my_array_get (guint index)
 * {
 * gpointer retval = NULL;
 *
 * if (!array)
 * return NULL;
 *
 * g_rw_lock_reader_lock (&lock);
 * if (index < array->len)
 * retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
 * g_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&lock);
 *
 * return retval;
 * }
 *
 * void
 * my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
 * {
 * g_rw_lock_writer_lock (&lock);
 *
 * if (!array)
 * array = g_ptr_array_new ();
 *
 * if (index >= array->len)
 * g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index+1);
 * g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;
 *
 * g_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&lock);
 * }
 * ]|
 * This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
 * (the my_array_get() function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
 * (the my_array_set() function) will only be allowed one at a time
 * and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
 * of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
 * functions is fully multi-thread safe now.
 *
 * If a #GRWLock is allocated in static storage then it can be used
 * without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call
 * g_rw_lock_init() on it and g_rw_lock_clear() when done.
 *
 * A GRWLock should only be accessed with the g_rw_lock_ functions.
