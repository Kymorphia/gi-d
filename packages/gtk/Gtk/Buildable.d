/**
 * `GtkBuildable` allows objects to extend and customize their deserialization
 * from ui files.
 * The interface includes methods for setting names and properties of objects,
 * parsing custom tags and constructing child objects.
 * The `GtkBuildable` interface is implemented by all widgets and
 * many of the non-widget objects that are provided by GTK. The
 * main user of this interface is [Gtk.Builder]. There should be
 * very little need for applications to call any of these functions directly.
 * An object only needs to implement this interface if it needs to extend the
 * `GtkBuilder` XML format or run any extra routines at deserialization time.
