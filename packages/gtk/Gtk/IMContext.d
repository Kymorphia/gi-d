/**
 * `GtkIMContext` defines the interface for GTK input methods.
 * `GtkIMContext` is used by GTK text input widgets like `GtkText`
 * to map from key events to Unicode character strings.
 * An input method may consume multiple key events in sequence before finally
 * outputting the composed result. This is called *preediting*, and an input
 * method may provide feedback about this process by displaying the intermediate
 * composition states as preedit text. To do so, the `GtkIMContext` will emit
 * signal@Gtk.IMContext::preedit-start, signal@Gtk.IMContext::preedit-changed
 * and signal@Gtk.IMContext::preedit-end signals.
 * For instance, the built-in GTK input method [Gtk.IMContextSimple]
 * implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding down the
 * <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys and then typing <kbd>u</kbd>
 * followed by the hexadecimal digits of the code point. When releasing the
 * <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys, preediting ends and the
 * character is inserted as text. For example,
 * Ctrl+Shift+u 2 0 A C
 * results in the â‚¬ sign.
 * Additional input methods can be made available for use by GTK widgets as
 * loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which
 * provides a `GIOExtension` for the extension point named "gtk-im-module".
 * To connect a widget to the users preferred input method, you should use
 * [Gtk.IMMulticontext].
