/**
 * #GAppInfoMonitor is a very simple object used for monitoring the app
 * info database for changes (newly installed or removed applications).
 *
 * Call g_app_info_monitor_get() to get a #GAppInfoMonitor and connect
 * to the #GAppInfoMonitor::changed signal. The signal will be emitted once when
 * the app info database changes, and will not be emitted again until after the
 * next call to g_app_info_get_all() or another `g_app_info_*()` function. This
 * is because monitoring the app info database for changes is expensive.
 *
 * The following functions will re-arm the #GAppInfoMonitor::changed signal so
 * it can be emitted again:
 * - g_app_info_get_all()
 * - g_app_info_get_all_for_type()
 * - g_app_info_get_default_for_type()
 * - g_app_info_get_fallback_for_type()
 * - g_app_info_get_recommended_for_type()
 * - g_desktop_app_info_get_implementations()
 * - g_desktop_app_info_new()
 * - g_desktop_app_info_new_from_filename()
 * - g_desktop_app_info_new_from_keyfile()
 * - g_desktop_app_info_search()
 *
 * In the usual case, applications should try to make note of the change
 * (doing things like invalidating caches) but not act on it.  In
 * particular, applications should avoid making calls to #GAppInfo APIs
 * in response to the change signal, deferring these until the time that
 * the updated data is actually required.  The exception to this case is when
 * application information is actually being displayed on the screen
 * (for example, during a search or when the list of all applications is shown).
 * The reason for this is that changes to the list of installed
 * applications often come in groups (like during system updates) and
 * rescanning the list on every change is pointless and expensive.
