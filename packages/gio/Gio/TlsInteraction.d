/**
 * `GTlsInteraction` provides a mechanism for the TLS connection and database
 * code to interact with the user. It can be used to ask the user for passwords.
 * To use a `GTlsInteraction` with a TLS connection use
 * [Gio.TlsConnection.setInteraction].
 * Callers should instantiate a derived class that implements the various
 * interaction methods to show the required dialogs.
 * Callers should use the 'invoke' functions like
 * [Gio.TlsInteraction.invokeAskPassword] to run interaction methods.
 * These functions make sure that the interaction is invoked in the main loop
 * and not in the current thread, if the current thread is not running the
 * main loop.
 * Derived classes can choose to implement whichever interactions methods theyâ€™d
 * like to support by overriding those virtual methods in their class
 * initialization function. Any interactions not implemented will return
 * `G_TLS_INTERACTION_UNHANDLED`. If a derived class implements an async method,
 * it must also implement the corresponding finish method.
