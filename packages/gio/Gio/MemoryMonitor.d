/**
 * #GMemoryMonitor will monitor system memory and suggest to the application
 * when to free memory so as to leave more room for other applications.
 * It is implemented on Linux using the [Low Memory Monitor](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/low-memory-monitor/)
 * ([API documentation](https://hadess.pages.freedesktop.org/low-memory-monitor/)).
 *
 * There is also an implementation for use inside Flatpak sandboxes.
 *
 * Possible actions to take when the signal is received are:
 *
 * - Free caches
 * - Save files that haven't been looked at in a while to disk, ready to be reopened when needed
 * - Run a garbage collection cycle
 * - Try and compress fragmented allocations
 * - Exit on idle if the process has no reason to stay around
 * - Call [`malloc_trim(3)`](man:malloc_trim) to return cached heap pages to
 * the kernel (if supported by your libc)
 *
 * Note that some actions may not always improve system performance, and so
 * should be profiled for your application. `malloc_trim()`, for example, may
 * make future heap allocations slower (due to releasing cached heap pages back
 * to the kernel).
 *
 * See #GMemoryMonitorWarningLevel for details on the various warning levels.
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * warning_cb (GMemoryMonitor *m, GMemoryMonitorWarningLevel level)

 * drop_caches ();

 * Don't forget to disconnect the #GMemoryMonitor::low-memory-warning
 * signal, and unref the #GMemoryMonitor itself when exiting.
