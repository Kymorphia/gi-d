 * #GActionGroup represents a group of actions. Actions can be used to

 * program to another, or to the outside world. Action groups are often
 * used together with a #GMenuModel that provides additional
 * representation data for displaying the actions to the user, e.g. in
 * a menu.
 *
 * The main way to interact with the actions in a GActionGroup is to
 * activate them with g_action_group_activate_action(). Activating an
 * action may require a #GVariant parameter. The required type of the
 * parameter can be inquired with g_action_group_get_action_parameter_type().
 * Actions may be disabled, see g_action_group_get_action_enabled().
 * Activating a disabled action has no effect.
 *
 * Actions may optionally have a state in the form of a #GVariant. The
 * current state of an action can be inquired with
 * g_action_group_get_action_state(). Activating a stateful action may
 * change its state, but it is also possible to set the state by calling
 * g_action_group_change_action_state().
 *
 * As typical example, consider a text editing application which has an
 * option to change the current font to 'bold'. A good way to represent
 * this would be a stateful action, with a boolean state. Activating the
 * action would toggle the state.
 *
 * Each action in the group has a unique name (which is a string).  All
 * method calls, except g_action_group_list_actions() take the name of
 * an action as an argument.
 *
 * The #GActionGroup API is meant to be the 'public' API to the action
 * group.  The calls here are exactly the interaction that 'external
 * forces' (eg: UI, incoming D-Bus messages, etc.) are supposed to have
 * with actions.  'Internal' APIs (ie: ones meant only to be accessed by
 * the action group implementation) are found on subclasses.  This is
 * why you will find - for example - g_action_group_get_action_enabled()
 * but not an equivalent set() call.
 *
 * Signals are emitted on the action group in response to state changes
 * on individual actions.
 *
 * Implementations of #GActionGroup should provide implementations for
 * the virtual functions g_action_group_list_actions() and
 * g_action_group_query_action().  The other virtual functions should
 * not be implemented - their "wrappers" are actually implemented with

/**
 * #GAppInfo and #GAppLaunchContext are used for describing and launching
 * applications installed on the system.
 *
 * As of GLib 2.20, URIs will always be converted to POSIX paths
 * (using g_file_get_path()) when using g_app_info_launch() even if
 * the application requested an URI and not a POSIX path. For example
 * for a desktop-file based application with Exec key `totem
 * %U` and a single URI, `sftp://foo/file.avi`, then
 * `/home/user/.gvfs/sftp on foo/file.avi` will be passed. This will
 * only work if a set of suitable GIO extensions (such as gvfs 2.26
 * compiled with FUSE support), is available and operational; if this
 * is not the case, the URI will be passed unmodified to the application.
 * Some URIs, such as `mailto:`, of course cannot be mapped to a POSIX
 * path (in gvfs there's no FUSE mount for it); such URIs will be
 * passed unmodified to the application.
 *
 * Specifically for gvfs 2.26 and later, the POSIX URI will be mapped
 * back to the GIO URI in the #GFile constructors (since gvfs
 * implements the #GVfs extension point). As such, if the application
 * needs to examine the URI, it needs to use g_file_get_uri() or
 * similar on #GFile. In other words, an application cannot assume
 * that the URI passed to e.g. g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() is
 * equal to the result of g_file_get_uri(). The following snippet
 * illustrates this:
 *
 * |[
 * GFile *f;
 * char *uri;
 *
 * file = g_file_new_for_commandline_arg (uri_from_commandline);
 *
 * uri = g_file_get_uri (file);
 * strcmp (uri, uri_from_commandline) == 0;
 * g_free (uri);
 *
 * if (g_file_has_uri_scheme (file, "cdda"))
 * {
 * // do something special with uri
 * }
 * g_object_unref (file);
 * ]|
 *
 * This code will work when both `cdda://sr0/Track 1.wav` and
 * `/home/user/.gvfs/cdda on sr0/Track 1.wav` is passed to the
 * application. It should be noted that it's generally not safe
 * for applications to rely on the format of a particular URIs.
 * Different launcher applications (e.g. file managers) may have
 * different ideas of what a given URI means.

/**
 * #GAppInfoMonitor is a very simple object used for monitoring the app

 *
 * Call g_app_info_monitor_get() to get a #GAppInfoMonitor and connect

 * the app info database changes, and will not be emitted again until after the
 * next call to g_app_info_get_all() or another `g_app_info_*()` function. This
 * is because monitoring the app info database for changes is expensive.
 *
 * The following functions will re-arm the #GAppInfoMonitor::changed signal so
 * it can be emitted again:
 * - g_app_info_get_all()
 * - g_app_info_get_all_for_type()
 * - g_app_info_get_default_for_type()
 * - g_app_info_get_fallback_for_type()

 * - g_desktop_app_info_new_from_filename()
 * - g_desktop_app_info_new_from_keyfile()
 * - g_desktop_app_info_search()
 *
 * In the usual case, applications should try to make note of the change
 * (doing things like invalidating caches) but not act on it.  In
 * particular, applications should avoid making calls to #GAppInfo APIs
 * in response to the change signal, deferring these until the time that
 * the updated data is actually required.  The exception to this case is when
 * application information is actually being displayed on the screen
 * (for example, during a search or when the list of all applications is shown).
 * The reason for this is that changes to the list of installed
 * applications often come in groups (like during system updates) and
 * rescanning the list on every change is pointless and expensive.

/**
 * A #GApplication is the foundation of an application.  It wraps some
 * low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
 * foundation for higher-level application classes such as
 * #GtkApplication or #MxApplication.  In general, you should not use
 * this class outside of a higher level framework.
 *
 * GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
 * a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
 * be changed using g_application_hold() and g_application_release(). If
 * it drops to zero, the application exits. Higher-level classes such as
 * #GtkApplication employ the use count to ensure that the application
 * stays alive as long as it has any opened windows.
 *
 * Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
 * uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
 * providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
 * with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
 * concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
 * desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
 * arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
 * running program. The already running instance of the program is
 * called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
 * always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
 * is used for communication.
 *
 * The use of #GApplication differs from some other commonly-used
 * uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
 * application is not expected to manually register itself and check
 * if it is the primary instance. Instead, the main() function of a
 * #GApplication should do very little more than instantiating the
 * application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
 * calling g_application_run(). All checks for uniqueness are done
 * internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
 * startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
 * is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
 * instance and g_application_run() promptly returns. See the code
 * examples below.
 *
 * If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the
 * same as that of a
 * [D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
 * Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
 * `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
 * For details on valid application identifiers, see g_application_id_is_valid().
 *
 * On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
 * on the user's session bus.  This means that the uniqueness of your
 * application is scoped to the current session.  It also means that your
 * application may provide additional services (through registration of other
 * object paths) at that bus name.  The registration of these object paths
 * should be done with the shared GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the
 * internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
 * (even if a main loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that
 * any object paths that you wish to register are registered before #GApplication
 * attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
 * g_application_register()).  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use
 * g_application_get_is_remote() to decide if you want to register object paths.
 *
 * GApplication also implements the #GActionGroup and #GActionMap
 * interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
 * g_action_map_add_action(). When invoking an action by calling
 * g_action_group_activate_action() on the application, it is always
 * invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
 * the session bus, and GIO provides the #GDBusActionGroup wrapper to
 * conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a #GDBusMenuModel wrapper
 * for remote access to exported #GMenuModels.
 *
 * Note: Due to the fact that actions are exported on the session bus,
 * using `maybe` parameters is not supported, since D-Bus does not support
 * `maybe` types.
 *
 * There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
 *
 * - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
 *
 * - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
 *
 * - by handling a command-line
 *
 * - via activating an action
 *
 * The #GApplication::startup signal lets you handle the application
 * initialization for all of these in a single place.
 *
 * Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
 * application, GApplication passes some ‘platform data’ from the
 * launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
 * #GVariant dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
 * data, override the @before_emit or @after_emit virtual functions
 * in your #GApplication subclass. When dealing with
 * #GApplicationCommandLine objects, the platform data is
 * directly available via g_application_command_line_get_cwd(),
 * g_application_command_line_get_environ() and
 * g_application_command_line_get_platform_data().
 *
 * As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
 * operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
 * "cwd"), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
 * variables and their values) of the calling process (key "environ").
 * The environment is only added to the platform data if the
 * %G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT flag is set. #GApplication subclasses
 * can add their own platform data by overriding the @add_platform_data
 * virtual function. For instance, #GtkApplication adds startup notification
 * data in this way.
 *
 * To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal or override the local_command_line()
 * vfunc, to parse them in either the primary instance or the local instance,
 * respectively.
 *

/**
 * #GApplicationCommandLine represents a command-line invocation of
 * an application.  It is created by #GApplication and emitted
 * in the #GApplication::command-line signal and virtual function.
 *
 * The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
 * with.  It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
 * local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
 * invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
 * commandline to this process).
 *
 * The GApplicationCommandLine object can provide the @argc and @argv
 * parameters for use with the #GOptionContext command-line parsing API,
 * with the g_application_command_line_get_arguments() function. See
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c][gapplication-example-cmdline3]
 * for an example.
 *
 * The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
 * messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.  The
 * lifecycle of the originally-invoked process is tied to the lifecycle
 * of this object (ie: the process exits when the last reference is
 * dropped).
 *
 * The main use for #GApplicationCommandLine (and the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
 * You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
 * your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
 * have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
 * in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
 * aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
 * does not return until the editing is done.
 *
 * Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
 * #GApplication::command-line handler. The launching instance exits
 * once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
 * the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
 * of the launching instance.

/**
 * Provides a base class for implementing asynchronous function results.
 *
 * Asynchronous operations are broken up into two separate operations
 * which are chained together by a #GAsyncReadyCallback. To begin
 * an asynchronous operation, provide a #GAsyncReadyCallback to the
 * asynchronous function. This callback will be triggered when the
 * operation has completed, and must be run in a later iteration of
 * the [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * from where the operation was initiated. It will be passed a
 * #GAsyncResult instance filled with the details of the operation's
 * success or failure, the object the asynchronous function was
 * started for and any error codes returned. The asynchronous callback
 * function is then expected to call the corresponding "_finish()"
 * function, passing the object the function was called for, the
 * #GAsyncResult instance, and (optionally) an @error to grab any
 * error conditions that may have occurred.
 *
 * The "_finish()" function for an operation takes the generic result
 * (of type #GAsyncResult) and returns the specific result that the
 * operation in question yields (e.g. a #GFileEnumerator for a
 * "enumerate children" operation). If the result or error status of the
 * operation is not needed, there is no need to call the "_finish()"
 * function; GIO will take care of cleaning up the result and error
 * information after the #GAsyncReadyCallback returns. You can pass
 * %NULL for the #GAsyncReadyCallback if you don't need to take any
 * action at all after the operation completes. Applications may also
 * take a reference to the #GAsyncResult and call "_finish()" later;
 * however, the "_finish()" function may be called at most once.
 *
 * Example of a typical asynchronous operation flow:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * void _theoretical_frobnitz_async (Theoretical         *t,
 * GCancellable        *c,
 * GAsyncReadyCallback  cb,
 * gpointer             u);
 *
 * gboolean _theoretical_frobnitz_finish (Theoretical   *t,
 * GAsyncResult  *res,
 * GError       **e);
 *
 * static void
 * frobnitz_result_func (GObject      *source_object,
 * GAsyncResult *res,
 * gpointer      user_data)
 * {
 * gboolean success = FALSE;
 *
 * success = _theoretical_frobnitz_finish (source_object, res, NULL);
 *
 * if (success)
 * g_printf ("Hurray!\n");
 * else
 * g_printf ("Uh oh!\n");
 *
 * ...
 *
 * }
 *
 * int main (int argc, void *argv[])
 * {
 * ...
 *
 * _theoretical_frobnitz_async (theoretical_data,
 * NULL,
 * frobnitz_result_func,
 * NULL);
 *
 * ...
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * The callback for an asynchronous operation is called only once, and is
 * always called, even in the case of a cancelled operation. On cancellation
 * the result is a %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED error.
 *
 * ## I/O Priority # {#io-priority}
 *
 * Many I/O-related asynchronous operations have a priority parameter,
 * which is used in certain cases to determine the order in which
 * operations are executed. They are not used to determine system-wide
 * I/O scheduling. Priorities are integers, with lower numbers indicating
 * higher priority. It is recommended to choose priorities between
 * %G_PRIORITY_LOW and %G_PRIORITY_HIGH, with %G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT
 * as a default.

 *
 * By default, a #GDBusServer or server-side #GDBusConnection will allow

 * want to allow D-Bus connections from processes owned by the same uid
 * as the server, since GLib 2.68, you should use the
 * %G_DBUS_SERVER_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRE_SAME_USER flag. It’s equivalent
 * to the following signal handler:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static gboolean
 * on_authorize_authenticated_peer (GDBusAuthObserver *observer,
 * GIOStream         *stream,

/**
 * The #GDBusConnection type is used for D-Bus connections to remote
 * peers such as a message buses. It is a low-level API that offers a
 * lot of flexibility. For instance, it lets you establish a connection
 * over any transport that can by represented as a #GIOStream.
 *
 * This class is rarely used directly in D-Bus clients. If you are writing
 * a D-Bus client, it is often easier to use the g_bus_own_name(),
 * g_bus_watch_name() or g_dbus_proxy_new_for_bus() APIs.
 *
 * As an exception to the usual GLib rule that a particular object must not
 * be used by two threads at the same time, #GDBusConnection's methods may be
 * called from any thread. This is so that g_bus_get() and g_bus_get_sync()
 * can safely return the same #GDBusConnection when called from any thread.
 *
 * Most of the ways to obtain a #GDBusConnection automatically initialize it
 * (i.e. connect to D-Bus): for instance, g_dbus_connection_new() and
 * g_bus_get(), and the synchronous versions of those methods, give you an
 * initialized connection. Language bindings for GIO should use
 * g_initable_new() or g_async_initable_new_async(), which also initialize the
 * connection.
 *
 * If you construct an uninitialized #GDBusConnection, such as via
 * g_object_new(), you must initialize it via g_initable_init() or
 * g_async_initable_init_async() before using its methods or properties.
 * Calling methods or accessing properties on a #GDBusConnection that has not
 * completed initialization successfully is considered to be invalid, and leads
 * to undefined behaviour. In particular, if initialization fails with a
 * #GError, the only valid thing you can do with that #GDBusConnection is to
 * free it with g_object_unref().

/**
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient is used to create, monitor and delete object
 * proxies for remote objects exported by a #GDBusObjectManagerServer (or any
 * code implementing the
 * [org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-objectmanager)
 * interface).
 *
 * Once an instance of this type has been created, you can connect to
 * the #GDBusObjectManager::object-added and
 * #GDBusObjectManager::object-removed signals and inspect the
 * #GDBusObjectProxy objects returned by
 * g_dbus_object_manager_get_objects().
 *
 * If the name for a #GDBusObjectManagerClient is not owned by anyone at
 * object construction time, the default behavior is to request the
 * message bus to launch an owner for the name. This behavior can be
 * disabled using the %G_DBUS_OBJECT_MANAGER_CLIENT_FLAGS_DO_NOT_AUTO_START
 * flag. It's also worth noting that this only works if the name of
 * interest is activatable in the first place. E.g. in some cases it
 * is not possible to launch an owner for the requested name. In this
 * case, #GDBusObjectManagerClient object construction still succeeds but
 * there will be no object proxies
 * (e.g. g_dbus_object_manager_get_objects() returns the empty list) and
 * the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner property is %NULL.
 *
 * The owner of the requested name can come and go (for example
 * consider a system service being restarted) – #GDBusObjectManagerClient
 * handles this case too; simply connect to the #GObject::notify
 * signal to watch for changes on the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner
 * property. When the name owner vanishes, the behavior is that
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is set to %NULL (this includes
 * emission of the #GObject::notify signal) and then
 * #GDBusObjectManager::object-removed signals are synthesized
 * for all currently existing object proxies. Since
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is %NULL when this happens, you can
 * use this information to disambiguate a synthesized signal from a
 * genuine signal caused by object removal on the remote
 * #GDBusObjectManager. Similarly, when a new name owner appears,
 * #GDBusObjectManager::object-added signals are synthesized
 * while #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is still %NULL. Only when all
 * object proxies have been added, the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner
 * is set to the new name owner (this includes emission of the
 * #GObject::notify signal).  Furthermore, you are guaranteed that
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner will alternate between a name owner
 * (e.g. `:1.42`) and %NULL even in the case where
 * the name of interest is atomically replaced
 *
 * Ultimately, #GDBusObjectManagerClient is used to obtain #GDBusProxy
 * instances. All signals (including the
 * org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties::PropertiesChanged signal)
 * delivered to #GDBusProxy instances are guaranteed to originate
 * from the name owner. This guarantee along with the behavior
 * described above, means that certain race conditions including the
 * "half the proxy is from the old owner and the other half is from
 * the new owner" problem cannot happen.
 *
 * To avoid having the application connect to signals on the returned
 * #GDBusObjectProxy and #GDBusProxy objects, the
 * #GDBusObject::interface-added,
 * #GDBusObject::interface-removed,
 * #GDBusProxy::g-properties-changed and
 * #GDBusProxy::g-signal signals
 * are also emitted on the #GDBusObjectManagerClient instance managing these
 * objects. The signals emitted are
 * #GDBusObjectManager::interface-added,
 * #GDBusObjectManager::interface-removed,
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient::interface-proxy-properties-changed and
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient::interface-proxy-signal.
 *
 * Note that all callbacks and signals are emitted in the
 * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * that the #GDBusObjectManagerClient object was constructed
 * in. Additionally, the #GDBusObjectProxy and #GDBusProxy objects

/**
 * #GDBusProxy is a base class used for proxies to access a D-Bus
 * interface on a remote object. A #GDBusProxy can be constructed for

 *
 * By default, #GDBusProxy will cache all properties (and listen to
 * changes) of the remote object, and proxy all signals that get
 * emitted. This behaviour can be changed by passing suitable
 * #GDBusProxyFlags when the proxy is created. If the proxy is for a
 * well-known name, the property cache is flushed when the name owner
 * vanishes and reloaded when a name owner appears.
 *
 * The unique name owner of the proxy's name is tracked and can be read from
 * #GDBusProxy:g-name-owner. Connect to the #GObject::notify signal to
 * get notified of changes. Additionally, only signals and property
 * changes emitted from the current name owner are considered and
 * calls are always sent to the current name owner. This avoids a
 * number of race conditions when the name is lost by one owner and
 * claimed by another. However, if no name owner currently exists,
 * then calls will be sent to the well-known name which may result in
 * the message bus launching an owner (unless
 * %G_DBUS_PROXY_FLAGS_DO_NOT_AUTO_START is set).
 *
 * If the proxy is for a stateless D-Bus service, where the name owner may
 * be started and stopped between calls, the #GDBusProxy:g-name-owner tracking
 * of #GDBusProxy will cause the proxy to drop signal and property changes from
 * the service after it has restarted for the first time. When interacting
 * with a stateless D-Bus service, do not use #GDBusProxy — use direct D-Bus
 * method calls and signal connections.
 *
 * The generic #GDBusProxy::g-properties-changed and
 * #GDBusProxy::g-signal signals are not very convenient to work with.
 * Therefore, the recommended way of working with proxies is to subclass
 * #GDBusProxy, and have more natural properties and signals in your derived
 * class. This [example][gdbus-example-gdbus-codegen] shows how this can
 * easily be done using the [gdbus-codegen][gdbus-codegen] tool.
 *
 * A #GDBusProxy instance can be used from multiple threads but note
 * that all signals (e.g. #GDBusProxy::g-signal, #GDBusProxy::g-properties-changed
 * and #GObject::notify) are emitted in the
 * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * of the thread where the instance was constructed.
 *
 * An example using a proxy for a well-known name can be found in

/**
 * A #GDatagramBased is a networking interface for representing datagram-based
 * communications. It is a more or less direct mapping of the core parts of the
 * BSD socket API in a portable GObject interface. It is implemented by
 * #GSocket, which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.
 *
 * #GDatagramBased is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used
 * alongside higher-level networking APIs such as #GIOStream.
 *
 * It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages
 * to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of
 * the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing
 * or system calls. For example, #GSocket uses recvmmsg() and sendmmsg() where
 * possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of
 * multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
 * assemble or disassemble a message.
 *
 * Each #GDatagramBased operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
 * for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for
 * timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an
 * error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a
 * %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation
 * will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
 * timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
 * %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT if no progress was made. To know when a call would
 * successfully run you can call g_datagram_based_condition_check() or
 * g_datagram_based_condition_wait(). You can also use
 * g_datagram_based_create_source() and attach it to a #GMainContext to get
 * callbacks when I/O is possible.
 *
 * When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to
 * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other function
 * said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
 * condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
 * instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
 * returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
 *
 * As with #GSocket, #GDatagramBaseds can be either connection oriented (for
 * example, SCTP) or connectionless (for example, UDP). #GDatagramBaseds must be
 * datagram-based, not stream-based. The interface does not cover connection
 * establishment — use methods on the underlying type to establish a connection
 * before sending and receiving data through the #GDatagramBased API. For
 * connectionless socket types the target/source address is specified or
 * received in each I/O operation.
 *
 * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GDatagramBased is not inherently thread safe.
 * To use a #GDatagramBased concurrently from multiple threads, you must
 * implement your own locking.

/**
 * #GFile is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a
 * virtual file system. #GFiles are lightweight, immutable objects
 * that do no I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that
 * #GFile objects do not represent files, merely an identifier for a
 * file. All file content I/O is implemented as streaming operations
 * (see #GInputStream and #GOutputStream).
 *
 * To construct a #GFile, you can use:
 * - g_file_new_for_path() if you have a path.
 * - g_file_new_for_uri() if you have a URI.
 * - g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() for a command line argument.
 * - g_file_new_tmp() to create a temporary file from a template.
 * - g_file_new_tmp_async() to asynchronously create a temporary file.
 * - g_file_new_tmp_dir_async() to asynchronously create a temporary directory.
 * - g_file_parse_name() from a UTF-8 string gotten from g_file_get_parse_name().
 * - g_file_new_build_filename() or g_file_new_build_filenamev() to create a file from path elements.
 *
 * One way to think of a #GFile is as an abstraction of a pathname. For
 * normal files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as
 * #GFiles are extensible it could also be something else that corresponds
 * to a pathname in a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
 *
 * #GFiles make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to
 * the files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with
 * #GFile using g_file_get_parent() to get an identifier for the parent
 * directory, g_file_get_child() to get a child within a directory,
 * g_file_resolve_relative_path() to resolve a relative path between two
 * #GFiles. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not end up at
 * the same root if you repeatedly call g_file_get_parent() on two different
 * files.
 *
 * All #GFiles have a basename (get with g_file_get_basename()). These names
 * are byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem
 * (relative to its parent directory) and there is no guarantees that they
 * have any particular charset encoding or even make any sense at all. If
 * you want to use filenames in a user interface you should use the display
 * name that you can get by requesting the
 * %G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME attribute with g_file_query_info().
 * This is guaranteed to be in UTF-8 and can be used in a user interface.
 * But always store the real basename or the #GFile to use to actually
 * access the file, because there is no way to go from a display name to
 * the actual name.
 *
 * Using #GFile as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path
 * in that there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance,
 * hard or soft links may cause two different #GFiles to refer to the same
 * file. Other possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems,
 * short and long names on FAT/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to
 * check if two #GFiles point to the same file you can query for the
 * %G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE attribute. Note that #GFile does some trivial
 * canonicalization of pathnames passed in, so that trivial differences in
 * the path string used at creation (duplicated slashes, slash at end of
 * path, "." or ".." path segments, etc) does not create different #GFiles.
 *
 * Many #GFile operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions
 * to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions
 * simply have _async() appended to their function names. The asynchronous
 * I/O functions call a #GAsyncReadyCallback which is then used to finalize
 * the operation, producing a GAsyncResult which is then passed to the
 * function's matching _finish() operation.
 *
 * It is highly recommended to use asynchronous calls when running within a
 * shared main loop, such as in the main thread of an application. This avoids
 * I/O operations blocking other sources on the main loop from being dispatched.
 * Synchronous I/O operations should be performed from worker threads. See the
 * [introduction to asynchronous programming section][async-programming] for
 * more.
 *
 * Some #GFile operations almost always take a noticeable amount of time, and
 * so do not have synchronous analogs. Notable cases include:
 * - g_file_mount_mountable() to mount a mountable file.
 * - g_file_unmount_mountable_with_operation() to unmount a mountable file.
 * - g_file_eject_mountable_with_operation() to eject a mountable file.
 *
 * ## Entity Tags # {#gfile-etag}
 *
 * One notable feature of #GFiles are entity tags, or "etags" for
 * short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
 * traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file
 * has been modified from the version on the file system. See the
 * HTTP 1.1
 * [specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)
 * for HTTP Etag headers, which are a very similar concept.

/**
 * Functionality for manipulating basic metadata for files. #GFileInfo
 * implements methods for getting information that all files should
 * contain, and allows for manipulation of extended attributes.
 *
 * See [GFileAttribute][gio-GFileAttribute] for more information on how
 * GIO handles file attributes.
 *
 * To obtain a #GFileInfo for a #GFile, use g_file_query_info() (or its
 * async variant). To obtain a #GFileInfo for a file input or output
 * stream, use g_file_input_stream_query_info() or
 * g_file_output_stream_query_info() (or their async variants).
 *
 * To change the actual attributes of a file, you should then set the
 * attribute in the #GFileInfo and call g_file_set_attributes_from_info()
 * or g_file_set_attributes_async() on a GFile.
 *
 * However, not all attributes can be changed in the file. For instance,
 * the actual size of a file cannot be changed via g_file_info_set_size().
 * You may call g_file_query_settable_attributes() and
 * g_file_query_writable_namespaces() to discover the settable attributes
 * of a particular file at runtime.
 *
 * The direct accessors, such as g_file_info_get_name(), are slightly more
 * optimized than the generic attribute accessors, such as
 * g_file_info_get_attribute_byte_string().This optimization will matter
 * only if calling the API in a tight loop.
 *
 * It is an error to call these accessors without specifying their required file
 * attributes when creating the #GFileInfo. Use g_file_info_has_attribute() or
 * g_file_info_list_attributes() to check what attributes are specified for a
 * #GFileInfo.
 *
 * #GFileAttributeMatcher allows for searching through a #GFileInfo for
 * attributes.

/**
 * GIOStream represents an object that has both read and write streams.
 * Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
 * but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
 * seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
 *
 * Examples of #GIOStream objects are #GSocketConnection, which represents
 * a two-way network connection; and #GFileIOStream, which represents a
 * file handle opened in read-write mode.
 *
 * To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
 * with g_io_stream_get_input_stream() and g_io_stream_get_output_stream().
 *
 * The #GIOStream object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
 * way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the #GIOStream
 * object alive. If the #GIOStream object is freed it will be closed, thus
 * closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
 * always return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.
 *
 * To close a stream use g_io_stream_close() which will close the common
 * stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
 * the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
 * substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
 * #GIOStream may still be open. However, some streams may support
 * "half-closed" states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
 *
 * Operations on #GIOStreams cannot be started while another operation on the
 * #GIOStream or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
 * read from the #GInputStream and write to the #GOutputStream simultaneously
 * (either in separate threads, or as asynchronous operations in the same
 * thread), but an application cannot start any #GIOStream operation while there
 * is a #GIOStream, #GInputStream or #GOutputStream operation in progress, and
 * an application can’t start any #GInputStream or #GOutputStream operation
 * while there is a #GIOStream operation in progress.
 *
 * This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
 * given #GMainContext (the thread-default context at the time the operation was
 * started), rather than entire streams being associated with a single
 * #GMainContext.
 *
 * GIO may run operations on #GIOStreams from other (worker) threads, and this
 * may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
 * as #GBufferedInputStream or #GTlsConnection. With such wrapper APIs,
 * application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped) stream when
 * the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such operations may
 * not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves the base
 * stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).

 * order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,

 * g_list_model_get_item() until it returns %NULL.
 *
 * An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
 * return the same object for a given position until all references to
 * it are gone.
 *
 * On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
 * objects that are currently "user visible", in order to facilitate the
 * maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
 * reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
 *
 * This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
 * thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
 * implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
 * the [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * in effect at the time that the model was created.
 *
 * Over time, it has established itself as good practice for listmodel
 * implementations to provide properties `item-type` and `n-items` to
 * ease working with them. While it is not required, it is recommended
 * that implementations provide these two properties. They should return
 * the values of g_list_model_get_item_type() and g_list_model_get_n_items()
 * respectively and be defined as such:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * properties[PROP_ITEM_TYPE] =
 * g_param_spec_gtype ("item-type", "", "", G_TYPE_OBJECT,
 * G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY | G_PARAM_READWRITE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
 * properties[PROP_N_ITEMS] =
 * g_param_spec_uint ("n-items", "", "", 0, G_MAXUINT, 0,
 * G_PARAM_READABLE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);

/**
 * #GMenuModel represents the contents of a menu -- an ordered list of
 * menu items. The items are associated with actions, which can be
 * activated through them. Items can be grouped in sections, and may
 * have submenus associated with them. Both items and sections usually
 * have some representation data, such as labels or icons. The type of
 * the associated action (ie whether it is stateful, and what kind of
 * state it has) can influence the representation of the item.
 *
 * The conceptual model of menus in #GMenuModel is hierarchical:
 * sections and submenus are again represented by #GMenuModels.
 * Menus themselves do not define their own roles. Rather, the role
 * of a particular #GMenuModel is defined by the item that references
 * it (or, in the case of the 'root' menu, is defined by the context
 * in which it is used).
 *
 * As an example, consider the visible portions of this menu:
 *
 * ## An example menu # {#menu-example}
 *
 * ![](menu-example.png)
 *
 * There are 8 "menus" visible in the screenshot: one menubar, two
 * submenus and 5 sections:
 *
 * - the toplevel menubar (containing 4 items)
 * - the View submenu (containing 3 sections)
 * - the first section of the View submenu (containing 2 items)
 * - the second section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
 * - the final section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
 * - the Highlight Mode submenu (containing 2 sections)
 * - the Sources section (containing 2 items)
 * - the Markup section (containing 2 items)
 *
 * The [example][menu-model] illustrates the conceptual connection between
 * these 8 menus. Each large block in the figure represents a menu and the
 * smaller blocks within the large block represent items in that menu. Some
 * items contain references to other menus.
 *
 * ## A menu example # {#menu-model}
 *
 * ![](menu-model.png)
 *
 * Notice that the separators visible in the [example][menu-example]
 * appear nowhere in the [menu model][menu-model]. This is because
 * separators are not explicitly represented in the menu model. Instead,
 * a separator is inserted between any two non-empty sections of a menu.
 * Section items can have labels just like any other item. In that case,
 * a display system may show a section header instead of a separator.
 *
 * The motivation for this abstract model of application controls is
 * that modern user interfaces tend to make these controls available
 * outside the application. Examples include global menus, jumplists,
 * dash boards, etc. To support such uses, it is necessary to 'export'
 * information about actions and their representation in menus, which
 * is exactly what the [GActionGroup exporter][gio-GActionGroup-exporter]
 * and the [GMenuModel exporter][gio-GMenuModel-exporter] do for
 * #GActionGroup and #GMenuModel. The client-side counterparts to
 * make use of the exported information are #GDBusActionGroup and
 * #GDBusMenuModel.
 *
 * The API of #GMenuModel is very generic, with iterators for the
 * attributes and links of an item, see g_menu_model_iterate_item_attributes()
 * and g_menu_model_iterate_item_links(). The 'standard' attributes and
 * link types have predefined names: %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_LABEL,
 * %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION, %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_TARGET, %G_MENU_LINK_SECTION
 * and %G_MENU_LINK_SUBMENU.
 *
 * Items in a #GMenuModel represent active controls if they refer to
 * an action that can get activated when the user interacts with the
 * menu item. The reference to the action is encoded by the string id
 * in the %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION attribute. An action id uniquely
 * identifies an action in an action group. Which action group(s) provide
 * actions depends on the context in which the menu model is used.
 * E.g. when the model is exported as the application menu of a
 * #GtkApplication, actions can be application-wide or window-specific
 * (and thus come from two different action groups). By convention, the
 * application-wide actions have names that start with "app.", while the
 * names of window-specific actions start with "win.".
 *
 * While a wide variety of stateful actions is possible, the following
 * is the minimum that is expected to be supported by all users of exported
 * menu information:
 * - an action with no parameter type and no state
 * - an action with no parameter type and boolean state
 * - an action with string parameter type and string state
 *
 * ## Stateless
 *
 * A stateless action typically corresponds to an ordinary menu item.
 *
 * Selecting such a menu item will activate the action (with no parameter).
 *
 * ## Boolean State
 *
 * An action with a boolean state will most typically be used with a "toggle"
 * or "switch" menu item. The state can be set directly, but activating the
 * action (with no parameter) results in the state being toggled.
 *
 * Selecting a toggle menu item will activate the action. The menu item should
 * be rendered as "checked" when the state is true.
 *
 * ## String Parameter and State
 *
 * Actions with string parameters and state will most typically be used to
 * represent an enumerated choice over the items available for a group of
 * radio menu items. Activating the action with a string parameter is
 * equivalent to setting that parameter as the state.
 *
 * Radio menu items, in addition to being associated with the action, will
 * have a target value. Selecting that menu item will result in activation
 * of the action with the target value as the parameter. The menu item should
 * be rendered as "selected" when the state of the action is equal to the
 * target value of the menu item.

 * A #GPropertyAction is a way to get a #GAction with a state value
 * reflecting and controlling the value of a #GObject property.
 *
 * The state of the action will correspond to the value of the property.
 * Changing it will change the property (assuming the requested value
 * matches the requirements as specified in the #GParamSpec).
 *
 * Only the most common types are presently supported.  Booleans are
 * mapped to booleans, strings to strings, signed/unsigned integers to
 * int32/uint32 and floats and doubles to doubles.
 *
 * If the property is an enum then the state will be string-typed and
 * conversion will automatically be performed between the enum value and
 * "nick" string as per the #GEnumValue table.
 *
 * Flags types are not currently supported.
 *
 * Properties of object types, boxed types and pointer types are not
 * supported and probably never will be.
 *
 * Properties of #GVariant types are not currently supported.
 *
 * If the property is boolean-valued then the action will have a NULL
 * parameter type, and activating the action (with no parameter) will
 * toggle the value of the property.
 *
 * In all other cases, the parameter type will correspond to the type of
 * the property.
 *
 * The general idea here is to reduce the number of locations where a
 * particular piece of state is kept (and therefore has to be synchronised
 * between). #GPropertyAction does not have a separate state that is kept
 * in sync with the property value -- its state is the property value.
 *
 * For example, it might be useful to create a #GAction corresponding to
 * the "visible-child-name" property of a #GtkStack so that the current
 * page can be switched from a menu.  The active radio indication in the
 * menu is then directly determined from the active page of the
 * #GtkStack.
 *
 * An anti-example would be binding the "active-id" property on a
 * #GtkComboBox.  This is because the state of the combobox itself is
 * probably uninteresting and is actually being used to control
 * something else.
 *
 * Another anti-example would be to bind to the "visible-child-name"
 * property of a #GtkStack if this value is actually stored in
 * #GSettings.  In that case, the real source of the value is
 * #GSettings.  If you want a #GAction to control a setting stored in
 * #GSettings, see g_settings_create_action() instead, and possibly
 * combine its use with g_settings_bind().

/**
 * Applications and libraries often contain binary or textual data that is
 * really part of the application, rather than user data. For instance
 * #GtkBuilder .ui files, splashscreen images, GMenu markup XML, CSS files,
 * icons, etc. These are often shipped as files in `$datadir/appname`, or
 * manually included as literal strings in the code.
 *
 * The #GResource API and the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
 * provide a convenient and efficient alternative to this which has some nice properties. You
 * maintain the files as normal files, so its easy to edit them, but during the build the files
 * are combined into a binary bundle that is linked into the executable. This means that loading
 * the resource files are efficient (as they are already in memory, shared with other instances) and
 * simple (no need to check for things like I/O errors or locate the files in the filesystem). It
 * also makes it easier to create relocatable applications.
 *
 * Resource files can also be marked as compressed. Such files will be included in the resource bundle
 * in a compressed form, but will be automatically uncompressed when the resource is used. This
 * is very useful e.g. for larger text files that are parsed once (or rarely) and then thrown away.
 *
 * Resource files can also be marked to be preprocessed, by setting the value of the
 * `preprocess` attribute to a comma-separated list of preprocessing options.
 * The only options currently supported are:
 *
 * `xml-stripblanks` which will use the xmllint command
 * to strip ignorable whitespace from the XML file. For this to work,
 * the `XMLLINT` environment variable must be set to the full path to
 * the xmllint executable, or xmllint must be in the `PATH`; otherwise
 * the preprocessing step is skipped.
 *
 * `to-pixdata` (deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32) which will use the
 * `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` command to convert images to the #GdkPixdata format,
 * which allows you to create pixbufs directly using the data inside the
 * resource file, rather than an (uncompressed) copy of it. For this, the
 * `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` program must be in the `PATH`, or the
 * `GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA` environment variable must be set to the full path to the
 * `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` executable; otherwise the resource compiler will abort.
 * `to-pixdata` has been deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32, as #GResource
 * supports embedding modern image formats just as well. Instead of using it,
 * embed a PNG or SVG file in your #GResource.
 *
 * `json-stripblanks` which will use the `json-glib-format` command to strip
 * ignorable whitespace from the JSON file. For this to work, the
 * `JSON_GLIB_FORMAT` environment variable must be set to the full path to the
 * `json-glib-format` executable, or it must be in the `PATH`;
 * otherwise the preprocessing step is skipped. In addition, at least version
 * 1.6 of `json-glib-format` is required.
 *
 * Resource files will be exported in the GResource namespace using the
 * combination of the given `prefix` and the filename from the `file` element.
 * The `alias` attribute can be used to alter the filename to expose them at a
 * different location in the resource namespace. Typically, this is used to
 * include files from a different source directory without exposing the source
 * directory in the resource namespace, as in the example below.
 *
 * Resource bundles are created by the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
 * which takes an XML file that describes the bundle, and a set of files that the XML references. These
 * are combined into a binary resource bundle.
 *
 * An example resource description:
 * |[
 * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 * <gresources>
 * <gresource prefix="/org/gtk/Example">
 * <file>data/splashscreen.png</file>
 * <file compressed="true">dialog.ui</file>
 * <file preprocess="xml-stripblanks">menumarkup.xml</file>
 * <file alias="example.css">data/example.css</file>
 * </gresource>
 * </gresources>
 * ]|
 *
 * This will create a resource bundle with the following files:
 * |[
 * /org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png
 * /org/gtk/Example/dialog.ui
 * /org/gtk/Example/menumarkup.xml
 * /org/gtk/Example/example.css
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that all resources in the process share the same namespace, so use Java-style
 * path prefixes (like in the above example) to avoid conflicts.
 *
 * You can then use [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] to compile the XML to a
 * binary bundle that you can load with g_resource_load(). However, its more common to use the --generate-source and
 * --generate-header arguments to create a source file and header to link directly into your application.
 * This will generate `get_resource()`, `register_resource()` and
 * `unregister_resource()` functions, prefixed by the `--c-name` argument passed
 * to [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources]. `get_resource()` returns
 * the generated #GResource object. The register and unregister functions
 * register the resource so its files can be accessed using
 * g_resources_lookup_data().
 *
 * Once a #GResource has been created and registered all the data in it can be accessed globally in the process by
 * using API calls like g_resources_open_stream() to stream the data or g_resources_lookup_data() to get a direct pointer
 * to the data. You can also use URIs like "resource:///org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png" with #GFile to access
 * the resource data.
 *
 * Some higher-level APIs, such as #GtkApplication, will automatically load
 * resources from certain well-known paths in the resource namespace as a
 * convenience. See the documentation for those APIs for details.
 *
 * There are two forms of the generated source, the default version uses the compiler support for constructor
 * and destructor functions (where available) to automatically create and register the #GResource on startup
 * or library load time. If you pass `--manual-register`, two functions to register/unregister the resource are created
 * instead. This requires an explicit initialization call in your application/library, but it works on all platforms,
 * even on the minor ones where constructors are not supported. (Constructor support is available for at least Win32, Mac OS and Linux.)
 *
 * Note that resource data can point directly into the data segment of e.g. a library, so if you are unloading libraries
 * during runtime you need to be very careful with keeping around pointers to data from a resource, as this goes away
 * when the library is unloaded. However, in practice this is not generally a problem, since most resource accesses
 * are for your own resources, and resource data is often used once, during parsing, and then released.
 *
 * When debugging a program or testing a change to an installed version, it is often useful to be able to
 * replace resources in the program or library, without recompiling, for debugging or quick hacking and testing
 * purposes. Since GLib 2.50, it is possible to use the `G_RESOURCE_OVERLAYS` environment variable to selectively overlay
 * resources with replacements from the filesystem.  It is a %G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR-separated list of substitutions to perform
 * during resource lookups. It is ignored when running in a setuid process.
 *
 * A substitution has the form
 *
 * |[
 * /org/gtk/libgtk=/home/desrt/gtk-overlay
 * ]|
 *
 * The part before the `=` is the resource subpath for which the overlay applies.  The part after is a
 * filesystem path which contains files and subdirectories as you would like to be loaded as resources with the
 * equivalent names.
 *
 * In the example above, if an application tried to load a resource with the resource path
 * `/org/gtk/libgtk/ui/gtkdialog.ui` then GResource would check the filesystem path
 * `/home/desrt/gtk-overlay/ui/gtkdialog.ui`.  If a file was found there, it would be used instead.  This is an
 * overlay, not an outright replacement, which means that if a file is not found at that path, the built-in
 * version will be used instead.  Whiteouts are not currently supported.
 *
 * Substitutions must start with a slash, and must not contain a trailing slash before the '='.  The path after
 * the slash should ideally be absolute, but this is not strictly required.  It is possible to overlay the
 * location of a single resource with an individual file.

 * When creating a GSettings instance, you have to specify a schema
 * that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
 * values, as well as some other information.
 *
 * Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
 * are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
 * can also be '[relocatable][gsettings-relocatable]', i.e. not equipped with
 * a fixed path. This is
 * useful e.g. when the schema describes an 'account', and you want to be
 * able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
 *
 * Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character ('/')
 * and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
 * be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
 * library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
 * "/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/" and "/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/".
 * Paths should not start with "/apps/", "/desktop/" or "/system/" as
 * they often did in GConf.
 *
 * Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
 * restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
 * values as #GVariant, and allows any #GVariantType for keys. Key names
 * are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and '-'. Furthermore,
 * the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
 * with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes.
 *
 * Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
 * localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
 * and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
 * `gettext-domain` attribute of the <schemalist> or <schema>
 * elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
 * the <default> element. The string which is translated includes all text in
 * the <default> element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
 *
 * The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
 * [locale category for
 * translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html#index-locale-categories-1).
 * The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
 * translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
 * XML comment immediately above the <default> element — it is recommended to
 * add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
 * implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
 * attribute can be set on the <default> element to disambiguate multiple
 * defaults which use the same string.
 *
 * For example:
 * |[
 * <!-- Translators: A list of words which are not allowed to be typed, in
 * GVariant serialization syntax.
 * See: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html -->
 * <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
 * ]|
 *
 * Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
 * #GVariants (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or runtime
 * errors will occur.
 *
 * GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
 * by the [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas]
 * utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
 *
 * A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
 * [gschema.dtd](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/gschema.dtd)
 *
 * The [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] tool expects schema
 * files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
 *
 * At runtime, schemas are identified by their id (as specified in the
 * id attribute of the <schema> element). The convention for schema
 * ids is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
 * e.g. "org.gnome.SessionManager". In particular, if the settings are
 * for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
 * and schema id should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
 * associated with one named application, the id should not use
 * StudlyCaps, e.g. "org.gnome.font-rendering".
 *
 * In addition to #GVariant types, keys can have types that have
 * enumerated types. These can be described by a <choice>,
 * <enum> or <flags> element, as seen in the
 * [example][schema-enumerated]. The underlying type of such a key
 * is string, but you can use g_settings_get_enum(), g_settings_set_enum(),
 * g_settings_get_flags(), g_settings_set_flags() access the numeric values
 * corresponding to the string value of enum and flags keys.
 *
 * An example for default value:
 * |[
 * <schemalist>
 * <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
 *
 * <key name="greeting" type="s">
 * <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
 * <summary>A greeting</summary>
 * <description>
 * Greeting of the invading martians
 * </description>
 * </key>
 *
 * <key name="box" type="(ii)">
 * <default>(20,30)</default>
 * </key>
 *
 * <key name="empty-string" type="s">
 * <default>""</default>
 * <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
 * </key>
 *
 * </schema>
 * </schemalist>
 * ]|
 *
 * An example for ranges, choices and enumerated types:
 * |[
 * <schemalist>
 *
 * <enum id="org.gtk.Test.myenum">
 * <value nick="first" value="1"/>
 * <value nick="second" value="2"/>
 * </enum>
 *
 * <flags id="org.gtk.Test.myflags">
 * <value nick="flag1" value="1"/>
 * <value nick="flag2" value="2"/>
 * <value nick="flag3" value="4"/>
 * </flags>
 *
 * <schema id="org.gtk.Test">
 *
 * <key name="key-with-range" type="i">
 * <range min="1" max="100"/>
 * <default>10</default>
 * </key>
 *
 * <key name="key-with-choices" type="s">
 * <choices>
 * <choice value='Elisabeth'/>
 * <choice value='Annabeth'/>
 * <choice value='Joe'/>
 * </choices>
 * <aliases>
 * <alias value='Anna' target='Annabeth'/>
 * <alias value='Beth' target='Elisabeth'/>
 * </aliases>
 * <default>'Joe'</default>
 * </key>
 *
 * <key name='enumerated-key' enum='org.gtk.Test.myenum'>
 * <default>'first'</default>
 * </key>
 *
 * <key name='flags-key' flags='org.gtk.Test.myflags'>
 * <default>["flag1","flag2"]</default>
 * </key>
 * </schema>
 * </schemalist>
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Vendor overrides
 *
 * Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
 * an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
 * to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
 * is inconvenient and error-prone,
 * [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] reads so-called vendor
 * override' files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
 * schema sources which can override default values. The schema id serves
 * as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
 * serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:
 * |[
 * [org.gtk.Example]
 * key1='string'
 * key2=1.5
 * ]|
 *
 * glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension
 * `.gschema.override`.
 *
 * ## Binding
 *
 * A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind #GObject properties
 * directly to settings, using g_settings_bind(). Once a GObject property
 * has been bound to a setting, changes on either side are automatically
 * propagated to the other side. GSettings handles details like mapping
 * between GObject and GVariant types, and preventing infinite cycles.
 *
 * This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
 * underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
 * looks for a boolean property with the name "sensitivity" and
 * automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
 * If this 'magic' gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
 * %G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY flag.
 *
 * ## Relocatable schemas # {#gsettings-relocatable}
 *
 * A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
 * <schema> element. By using g_settings_new_with_path(), a #GSettings object
 * can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
 * instance. Paths passed to g_settings_new_with_path() will typically be
 * constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
 * identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
 * be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
 * dependency library.
 *
 * For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
 * for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
 * `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
 * `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
 * `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
 * they can be specified as <child> elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
 * |[
 * <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
 * <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
 * </schema>
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Build system integration # {#gsettings-build-system}
 *
 * GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
 * installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
 * following to your `configure.ac`:
 * |[
 * GLIB_GSETTINGS
 * ]|
 *
 * In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
 * install the named schema:
 * |[
 * gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
 *
 * @GSETTINGS_RULES@
 * ]|
 *
 * No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
 * translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
 * be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
 * 0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
 * |[
 * data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ]|
 *
 * Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
 * |[
 * [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ]|
 *
 * GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the <summary> and
 * <description> elements, and also any <default> elements which have a `l10n`
 * attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml` file
 * by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
 * `.gschema.xml.in` template.
 *
 * If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
 * schema, it can either be defined manually using an <enum> element in the
 * schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
 * approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
 * synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
 * |[
 * gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
 * gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
 * ]|
 *
 * `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
 * which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
 * `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
 * automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
 * rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
 * `EXTRA_DIST`.

/**
 * The #GSettingsSchemaSource and #GSettingsSchema APIs provide a
 * mechanism for advanced control over the loading of schemas and a
 * mechanism for introspecting their content.
 *
 * Plugin loading systems that wish to provide plugins a way to access
 * settings face the problem of how to make the schemas for these
 * settings visible to GSettings.  Typically, a plugin will want to ship
 * the schema along with itself and it won't be installed into the
 * standard system directories for schemas.
 *
 * #GSettingsSchemaSource provides a mechanism for dealing with this by
 * allowing the creation of a new 'schema source' from which schemas can
 * be acquired.  This schema source can then become part of the metadata
 * associated with the plugin and queried whenever the plugin requires
 * access to some settings.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * typedef struct
 * {
 * ...
 * GSettingsSchemaSource *schema_source;
 * ...
 * } Plugin;
 *
 * Plugin *
 * initialise_plugin (const gchar *dir)
 * {
 * Plugin *plugin;
 *
 * ...
 *
 * plugin->schema_source =
 * g_settings_schema_source_new_from_directory (dir,
 * g_settings_schema_source_get_default (), FALSE, NULL);
 *
 * ...
 *
 * return plugin;
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * GSettings *
 * plugin_get_settings (Plugin      *plugin,
 * const gchar *schema_id)
 * {
 * GSettingsSchema *schema;
 *
 * if (schema_id == NULL)
 * schema_id = plugin->identifier;
 *
 * schema = g_settings_schema_source_lookup (plugin->schema_source,
 * schema_id, FALSE);
 *
 * if (schema == NULL)
 * {
 * ... disable the plugin or abort, etc ...
 * }
 *
 * return g_settings_new_full (schema, NULL, NULL);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * The code above shows how hooks should be added to the code that
 * initialises (or enables) the plugin to create the schema source and
 * how an API can be added to the plugin system to provide a convenient
 * way for the plugin to access its settings, using the schemas that it
 * ships.
 *
 * From the standpoint of the plugin, it would need to ensure that it
 * ships a gschemas.compiled file as part of itself, and then simply do
 * the following:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * {
 * GSettings *settings;
 * gint some_value;
 *
 * settings = plugin_get_settings (self, NULL);
 * some_value = g_settings_get_int (settings, "some-value");
 * ...
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * It's also possible that the plugin system expects the schema source
 * files (ie: .gschema.xml files) instead of a gschemas.compiled file.
 * In that case, the plugin loading system must compile the schemas for
 * itself before attempting to create the settings source.

/**
 * As of GLib 2.46, #GSimpleAsyncResult is deprecated in favor of
 * #GTask, which provides a simpler API.
 *
 * #GSimpleAsyncResult implements #GAsyncResult.
 *
 * GSimpleAsyncResult handles #GAsyncReadyCallbacks, error
 * reporting, operation cancellation and the final state of an operation,
 * completely transparent to the application. Results can be returned
 * as a pointer e.g. for functions that return data that is collected
 * asynchronously, a boolean value for checking the success or failure
 * of an operation, or a #gssize for operations which return the number
 * of bytes modified by the operation; all of the simple return cases
 * are covered.
 *
 * Most of the time, an application will not need to know of the details
 * of this API; it is handled transparently, and any necessary operations
 * are handled by #GAsyncResult's interface. However, if implementing a
 * new GIO module, for writing language bindings, or for complex
 * applications that need better control of how asynchronous operations
 * are completed, it is important to understand this functionality.
 *
 * GSimpleAsyncResults are tagged with the calling function to ensure
 * that asynchronous functions and their finishing functions are used
 * together correctly.
 *
 * To create a new #GSimpleAsyncResult, call g_simple_async_result_new().
 * If the result needs to be created for a #GError, use
 * g_simple_async_result_new_from_error() or
 * g_simple_async_result_new_take_error(). If a #GError is not available
 * (e.g. the asynchronous operation's doesn't take a #GError argument),
 * but the result still needs to be created for an error condition, use
 * g_simple_async_result_new_error() (or g_simple_async_result_set_error_va()
 * if your application or binding requires passing a variable argument list
 * directly), and the error can then be propagated through the use of
 * g_simple_async_result_propagate_error().
 *
 * An asynchronous operation can be made to ignore a cancellation event by
 * calling g_simple_async_result_set_handle_cancellation() with a
 * #GSimpleAsyncResult for the operation and %FALSE. This is useful for
 * operations that are dangerous to cancel, such as close (which would
 * cause a leak if cancelled before being run).
 *
 * GSimpleAsyncResult can integrate into GLib's event loop, #GMainLoop,
 * or it can use #GThreads.
 * g_simple_async_result_complete() will finish an I/O task directly
 * from the point where it is called. g_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle()
 * will finish it from an idle handler in the
 * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * where the #GSimpleAsyncResult was created.
 * g_simple_async_result_run_in_thread() will run the job in a
 * separate thread and then use
 * g_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle() to deliver the result.
 *
 * To set the results of an asynchronous function,
 * g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer(),
 * g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gboolean(), and
 * g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gssize()
 * are provided, setting the operation's result to a gpointer, gboolean, or
 * gssize, respectively.
 *
 * Likewise, to get the result of an asynchronous function,
 * g_simple_async_result_get_op_res_gpointer(),
 * g_simple_async_result_get_op_res_gboolean(), and
 * g_simple_async_result_get_op_res_gssize() are
 * provided, getting the operation's result as a gpointer, gboolean, and
 * gssize, respectively.
 *
 * For the details of the requirements implementations must respect, see
 * #GAsyncResult.  A typical implementation of an asynchronous operation
 * using GSimpleAsyncResult looks something like this:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * baked_cb (Cake    *cake,

 * g_object_ref (cake),

 *
 *
 * // In this example, we assume that baked_cb is called as a callback from

 * or g_socket_condition_wait(). You can also use g_socket_create_source() and
 * attach it to a #GMainContext to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
 * Note that all sockets are always set to non blocking mode in the system, and
 * blocking mode is emulated in GSocket.
 *
 * When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
 * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other
 * function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case
 * of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other
 * reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable
 * until a write returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
 *
 * #GSockets can be either connection oriented or datagram based.
 * For connection oriented types you must first establish a connection by
 * either connecting to an address or accepting a connection from another
 * address. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is
 * specified or received in each I/O operation.
 *
 * All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
 *
 * Note that creating a #GSocket causes the signal %SIGPIPE to be
 * ignored for the remainder of the program. If you are writing a
 * command-line utility that uses #GSocket, you may need to take into
 * account the fact that your program will not automatically be killed
 * if it tries to write to %stdout after it has been closed.
 *
 * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GSocket is not inherently thread safe. To use
 * a #GSocket concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
 * locking.

/**
 * #GSubprocess allows the creation of and interaction with child
 * processes.
 *
 * Processes can be communicated with using standard GIO-style APIs (ie:
 * #GInputStream, #GOutputStream).  There are GIO-style APIs to wait for
 * process termination (ie: cancellable and with an asynchronous
 * variant).
 *
 * There is an API to force a process to terminate, as well as a
 * race-free API for sending UNIX signals to a subprocess.
 *
 * One major advantage that GIO brings over the core GLib library is
 * comprehensive API for asynchronous I/O, such
 * g_output_stream_splice_async().  This makes GSubprocess
 * significantly more powerful and flexible than equivalent APIs in
 * some other languages such as the `subprocess.py`
 * included with Python.  For example, using #GSubprocess one could
 * create two child processes, reading standard output from the first,
 * processing it, and writing to the input stream of the second, all
 * without blocking the main loop.
 *
 * A powerful g_subprocess_communicate() API is provided similar to the
 * `communicate()` method of `subprocess.py`. This enables very easy
 * interaction with a subprocess that has been opened with pipes.
 *
 * #GSubprocess defaults to tight control over the file descriptors open
 * in the child process, avoiding dangling-fd issues that are caused by
 * a simple fork()/exec().  The only open file descriptors in the
 * spawned process are ones that were explicitly specified by the
 * #GSubprocess API (unless %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_INHERIT_FDS was
 * specified).
 *
 * #GSubprocess will quickly reap all child processes as they exit,
 * avoiding "zombie processes" remaining around for long periods of
 * time.  g_subprocess_wait() can be used to wait for this to happen,
 * but it will happen even without the call being explicitly made.
 *
 * As a matter of principle, #GSubprocess has no API that accepts
 * shell-style space-separated strings.  It will, however, match the
 * typical shell behaviour of searching the PATH for executables that do
 * not contain a directory separator in their name. By default, the `PATH`
 * of the current process is used.  You can specify
 * %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP to use the `PATH` of the
 * launcher environment instead.
 *
 * #GSubprocess attempts to have a very simple API for most uses (ie:
 * spawning a subprocess with arguments and support for most typical
 * kinds of input and output redirection).  See g_subprocess_new(). The
 * #GSubprocessLauncher API is provided for more complicated cases
 * (advanced types of redirection, environment variable manipulation,
 * change of working directory, child setup functions, etc).
 *
 * A typical use of #GSubprocess will involve calling
 * g_subprocess_new(), followed by g_subprocess_wait_async() or
 * g_subprocess_wait().  After the process exits, the status can be
 * checked using functions such as g_subprocess_get_if_exited() (which
 * are similar to the familiar WIFEXITED-style POSIX macros).

/**
 * A #GTask represents and manages a cancellable "task".
 *
 * ## Asynchronous operations
 *
 * The most common usage of #GTask is as a #GAsyncResult, to
 * manage data during an asynchronous operation. You call
 * g_task_new() in the "start" method, followed by
 * g_task_set_task_data() and the like if you need to keep some
 * additional data associated with the task, and then pass the
 * task object around through your asynchronous operation.
 * Eventually, you will call a method such as
 * g_task_return_pointer() or g_task_return_error(), which will
 * save the value you give it and then invoke the task's callback
 * function in the
 * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * where it was created (waiting until the next iteration of the main
 * loop first, if necessary). The caller will pass the #GTask back to
 * the operation's finish function (as a #GAsyncResult), and you can
 * use g_task_propagate_pointer() or the like to extract the
 * return value.
 *
 * Using #GTask requires the thread-default #GMainContext from when the
 * #GTask was constructed to be running at least until the task has completed
 * and its data has been freed.
 *
 * If a #GTask has been constructed and its callback set, it is an error to
 * not call `g_task_return_*()` on it. GLib will warn at runtime if this happens
 * (since 2.76).
 *
 * Here is an example for using GTask as a GAsyncResult:

 *
 * #GTask also tries to simplify asynchronous operations that

 * You can use g_task_run_in_thread() to turn a synchronous
 * operation into an asynchronous one, by running it in a thread.
 * When it completes, the result will be dispatched to the
 * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * where the #GTask was created.
 *

 *
 * ## Adding cancellability to uncancellable tasks
 *
 * Finally, g_task_run_in_thread() and g_task_run_in_thread_sync()
 * can be used to turn an uncancellable operation into a
 * cancellable one. If you call g_task_set_return_on_cancel(),
 * passing %TRUE, then if the task's #GCancellable is cancelled,
 * it will return control back to the caller immediately, while
 * allowing the task thread to continue running in the background
 * (and simply discarding its result when it finally does finish).
 * Provided that the task thread is careful about how it uses
 * locks and other externally-visible resources, this allows you
 * to make "GLib-friendly" asynchronous and cancellable
 * synchronous variants of blocking APIs.

 *
 * ## Porting from GSimpleAsyncResult
 *
 * #GTask's API attempts to be simpler than #GSimpleAsyncResult's
 * in several ways:
 * - You can save task-specific data with g_task_set_task_data(), and
 * retrieve it later with g_task_get_task_data(). This replaces the
 * abuse of g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer() for the same
 * purpose with #GSimpleAsyncResult.
 * - In addition to the task data, #GTask also keeps track of the
 * [priority][io-priority], #GCancellable, and
 * #GMainContext associated with the task, so tasks that consist of
 * a chain of simpler asynchronous operations will have easy access
 * to those values when starting each sub-task.
 * - g_task_return_error_if_cancelled() provides simplified
 * handling for cancellation. In addition, cancellation
 * overrides any other #GTask return value by default, like
 * #GSimpleAsyncResult does when
 * g_simple_async_result_set_check_cancellable() is called.
 * (You can use g_task_set_check_cancellable() to turn off that
 * behavior.) On the other hand, g_task_run_in_thread()
 * guarantees that it will always run your
 * `task_func`, even if the task's #GCancellable
 * is already cancelled before the task gets a chance to run;
 * you can start your `task_func` with a
 * g_task_return_error_if_cancelled() check if you need the
 * old behavior.
 * - The "return" methods (eg, g_task_return_pointer())
 * automatically cause the task to be "completed" as well, and
 * there is no need to worry about the "complete" vs "complete
 * in idle" distinction. (#GTask automatically figures out
 * whether the task's callback can be invoked directly, or
 * if it needs to be sent to another #GMainContext, or delayed
 * until the next iteration of the current #GMainContext.)
 * - The "finish" functions for #GTask based operations are generally
 * much simpler than #GSimpleAsyncResult ones, normally consisting
 * of only a single call to g_task_propagate_pointer() or the like.
 * Since g_task_propagate_pointer() "steals" the return value from
 * the #GTask, it is not necessary to juggle pointers around to
 * prevent it from being freed twice.
 * - With #GSimpleAsyncResult, it was common to call
 * g_simple_async_result_propagate_error() from the
 * `_finish()` wrapper function, and have
 * virtual method implementations only deal with successful
 * returns. This behavior is deprecated, because it makes it
 * difficult for a subclass to chain to a parent class's async
 * methods. Instead, the wrapper function should just be a
 * simple wrapper, and the virtual method should call an
 * appropriate `g_task_propagate_` function.
 * Note that wrapper methods can now use
 * g_async_result_legacy_propagate_error() to do old-style
 * #GSimpleAsyncResult error-returning behavior, and
 * g_async_result_is_tagged() to check if a result is tagged as
 * having come from the `_async()` wrapper
 * function (for "short-circuit" results, such as when passing
 * 0 to g_input_stream_read_async()).
 *
 * ## Thread-safety considerations
 *
 * Due to some infelicities in the API design, there is a
 * thread-safety concern that users of GTask have to be aware of:
 *
 * If the `main` thread drops its last reference to the source object
 * or the task data before the task is finalized, then the finalizers
 * of these objects may be called on the worker thread.
 *
 * This is a problem if the finalizers use non-threadsafe API, and
 * can lead to hard-to-debug crashes. Possible workarounds include:
 *
 * - Clear task data in a signal handler for `notify::completed`
 *
 * - Keep iterating a main context in the main thread and defer
 * dropping the reference to the source object to that main
 * context when the task is finalized

/**
 * A helper class for testing code which uses D-Bus without touching the user's
 * session bus.
 *
 * Note that #GTestDBus modifies the user’s environment, calling setenv().
 * This is not thread-safe, so all #GTestDBus calls should be completed before
 * threads are spawned, or should have appropriate locking to ensure no access
 * conflicts to environment variables shared between #GTestDBus and other
 * threads.
 *
 * ## Creating unit tests using GTestDBus
 *
 * Testing of D-Bus services can be tricky because normally we only ever run
 * D-Bus services over an existing instance of the D-Bus daemon thus we
 * usually don't activate D-Bus services that are not yet installed into the
 * target system. The #GTestDBus object makes this easier for us by taking care
 * of the lower level tasks such as running a private D-Bus daemon and looking
 * up uninstalled services in customizable locations, typically in your source
 * code tree.
 *
 * The first thing you will need is a separate service description file for the
 * D-Bus daemon. Typically a `services` subdirectory of your `tests` directory
 * is a good place to put this file.
 *
 * The service file should list your service along with an absolute path to the
 * uninstalled service executable in your source tree. Using autotools we would
 * achieve this by adding a file such as `my-server.service.in` in the services
 * directory and have it processed by configure.
 * |[
 * [D-BUS Service]
 * Name=org.gtk.GDBus.Examples.ObjectManager
 * Exec=@abs_top_builddir@/gio/tests/gdbus-example-objectmanager-server
 * ]|
 * You will also need to indicate this service directory in your test
 * fixtures, so you will need to pass the path while compiling your
 * test cases. Typically this is done with autotools with an added
 * preprocessor flag specified to compile your tests such as:
 * |[
 * -DTEST_SERVICES=\""$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/services"\"
 * ]|
 * Once you have a service definition file which is local to your source tree,
 * you can proceed to set up a GTest fixture using the #GTestDBus scaffolding.
 *
 * An example of a test fixture for D-Bus services can be found
 * here:
 * [gdbus-test-fixture.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-test-fixture.c)
 *
 * Note that these examples only deal with isolating the D-Bus aspect of your
 * service. To successfully run isolated unit tests on your service you may need
 * some additional modifications to your test case fixture. For example; if your
 * service uses GSettings and installs a schema then it is important that your test service
 * not load the schema in the ordinary installed location (chances are that your service
 * and schema files are not yet installed, or worse; there is an older version of the
 * schema file sitting in the install location).
 *
 * Most of the time we can work around these obstacles using the
 * environment. Since the environment is inherited by the D-Bus daemon
 * created by #GTestDBus and then in turn inherited by any services the
 * D-Bus daemon activates, using the setup routine for your fixture is
 * a practical place to help sandbox your runtime environment. For the
 * rather typical GSettings case we can work around this by setting
 * `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` to the in tree directory holding your schemas
 * in the above fixture_setup() routine.
 *
 * The GSettings schemas need to be locally pre-compiled for this to work. This can be achieved
 * by compiling the schemas locally as a step before running test cases, an autotools setup might
 * do the following in the directory holding schemas:
 * |[
 * all-am:
 * $(GLIB_COMPILE_SCHEMAS) .
 *
 * CLEANFILES += gschemas.compiled
 * ]|

/**
 * The #GVolume interface represents user-visible objects that can be
 * mounted. Note, when porting from GnomeVFS, #GVolume is the moral
 * equivalent of #GnomeVFSDrive.
 *
 * Mounting a #GVolume instance is an asynchronous operation. For more
 * information about asynchronous operations, see #GAsyncResult and
 * #GTask. To mount a #GVolume, first call g_volume_mount() with (at
 * least) the #GVolume instance, optionally a #GMountOperation object
 * and a #GAsyncReadyCallback.
 *
 * Typically, one will only want to pass %NULL for the
 * #GMountOperation if automounting all volumes when a desktop session
 * starts since it's not desirable to put up a lot of dialogs asking
 * for credentials.
 *
 * The callback will be fired when the operation has resolved (either
 * with success or failure), and a #GAsyncResult instance will be
 * passed to the callback.  That callback should then call
 * g_volume_mount_finish() with the #GVolume instance and the
 * #GAsyncResult data to see if the operation was completed
 * successfully.  If an @error is present when g_volume_mount_finish()
 * is called, then it will be filled with any error information.
 *
 * ## Volume Identifiers # {#volume-identifier}
 *
 * It is sometimes necessary to directly access the underlying
 * operating system object behind a volume (e.g. for passing a volume
 * to an application via the commandline). For this purpose, GIO
 * allows to obtain an 'identifier' for the volume. There can be
 * different kinds of identifiers, such as Hal UDIs, filesystem labels,
 * traditional Unix devices (e.g. `/dev/sda2`), UUIDs. GIO uses predefined
 * strings as names for the different kinds of identifiers:
 * %G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UUID, %G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_LABEL, etc.
 * Use g_volume_get_identifier() to obtain an identifier for a volume.
 *
 *
 * Note that %G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_HAL_UDI will only be available
 * when the gvfs hal volume monitor is in use. Other volume monitors
 * will generally be able to provide the %G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UNIX_DEVICE
 * identifier, which can be used to obtain a hal device by means of
 * libhal_manager_find_device_string_match().
